This website is run by a working group of the [IEEE RAS technical committee on Agricultural Robotics and Automation](http://ieeeagra.com/). The purpose of the site is to publicize released datasets that are relevant to agricultural robotics research.  We hope that through this project members of the community can find these datasets quickly. We do not host the datasets here; in the future, we'll give some links to organizations who do host datasets.

This is a new undertaking, and this website is quite under construction.  Please have patience with us as we get it up and running!
